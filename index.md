## What is this?
I got fed up of not having a really simple but reliable way to validate public DNS resolution code for things like the DNS resource in (@aelsabbahy's) awesome server validation tool: [goss](https://goss.rocks).

Sure I could use things like google.com or other DNS addresses but I can't guarantee that they won't change or be advertised differently around the globe. SO here is a bunch of DNS records that don;t resolve to anything (deliberately) and won't ever change.

Maybe eventually I'll make some tools available to interact a bit more with DNS (like we need more?).

### What records are available?
